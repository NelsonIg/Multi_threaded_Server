# Multi_threaded_Server
This project demonstrates how to handle multiple clients and to transfer a given textfile, png, jpg etc. from one server to its clients. In addition, server and client can be controlled via a ![Gui](https://github.com/NelsonIg/Multi_threaded_Server/tree/master/images/screenshot.PNG).

Module "threaded_networking":
- Contains Server and Client
- Server is subclass of Thread.

1. Start "serverGui.py"

2. Start "clientGui.py"
